# Smart-Contact-Manager

This is a learning Project, the main Objective of this project to create an application which stores contacts in very efficient way and provides a smarter way of handling contacts with fully Authentication and Authorization. We created this project using Spring Boot Thymeleaf with MVC Architecture and for Authentication and Authorization we have used Spring Security.

- Spring Boot is used to develop back-end and Spring Data JPA is used for performing Database CRUD operations.
- HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Thymeleaf as template Engine is used to develop the front end.
- SQLLite3 for Database.

For someone who wants to run this application in their IDE's (system or Machine) can simply download and run this without any changes in configuration.
As i have used SQLLite3 for DATABASE it will generate a .db file as database. And you don't even need a username & password.
